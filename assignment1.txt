1. Does the graph have the same characteristics of a random or a power-law network?
A power-law network is characterized by a degree distribution that follows a power-law pattern, meaning a small number of nodes (hubs) have a high degree, while the majority of nodes have a low degree. This is in contrast to a random network, where most nodes have a similar degree. 
Our report indicates that the degree distribution follows a power-law distribution with an alpha value of 5.371203801764364. The R value (1.587270679150631) and the p value (0.16511922233103737) suggests a good fit to a power-law model, having an R value closer to 1 which indicates a perfect power-law distribution. Therefore, we can conclude that the network exhibits characteristics of a power-law network.


2. Which are the most important nodes, with respect to a given centrality measure?
Degree Centrality: This measure indicates the number of direct connections a node has. Higher degree centrality means the node is more connected within the network. The nodes with the highest degree centrality are Node 17056 (0.01301) and Node 197 (0.01001).
Betweenness Centrality: This measure indicates how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. The highest betweenness centrality nodes are Node 197 (0.00164),
and Node 5183 (0.00114).
Closeness Centrality: This measure indicates how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. The highest closeness centrality nodes are Node 197 (0.02051) and Node 15481 (0.01817)​​.
These measures identify Node 197, Node 5183, Node 17056 and Node 15481 are important across different centrality metrics.


3. Are the paths short with respect to the size of the network?
The average shortest path length in the network is 4.201741654571843, which means that on average, you can get from any node to any other node in just over 4 steps. And the longest part i.e diameter is 11. So for our a network with 1000 nodes, these values suggest that most nodes can be reached from any other node in a small number of steps, indicating the presence of the small-world network.


4. Is the network dense?
The density of the network is 0.0006006006006006006, which is much lower than the threshold of 0.1 used to distinguish between sparse and dense networks. A low density indicates that there are relatively few edges compared to the number of possible edges, which means the network is sparse.


5. Is the network assortative?
The assortativity measure for this network is 0.186005882877262, which is positive but close to 0 which indicates a slight tendency for nodes with similar numbers of connections to connect with each other.
